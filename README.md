# CS-221 Semester Project
## Implementing Blockchain by using DSA
For our **CS-221** Semester Project, we will be working on small scale replica of Blockchain using different concepts we learn in our **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.
Our project aims to make Blockchain accessible and easy to understand for the masses and to provide them with a platform to interact with and learn the processes behind Blockchain.
Through our project, we aim to increase technical literacy and demystify Blockchain.

For project to run, run following commands in terminal (in deliverable 4):
g++ Project.cpp graph.cpp -o Project
.\Project
