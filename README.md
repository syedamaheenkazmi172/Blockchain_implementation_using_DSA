#CS-221 Semester Project
##Implementing Blockchain by using DSA
For our **CS-221** Semester Project, we will be working on small scale replica of Blockchain using different concepts we learn in our **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.
Our project aims to make Blockchain accessible and easy to understand for the masses and to provide them with a platform to interact with and learn the processes behind Blockchain.
Through our project, we aim to increase technical literacy and demystify Blockchain.
